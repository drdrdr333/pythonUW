Create a file in a text editor called questions.csv that stores the following header and questions. Feel free to add more fields and questions.
question_id,question
12,What is your phone number?
10,What is your email?



Create a python program that adds questions to our csv file.
The program starts by reading in all the questions in the questions.csv file
Prints them all out to the console, formatted nicely (try playing around with string formatting)
Asks the user for a new question to add to the CSV file
Generates a unique integer id for that question
Appends the new question back into the file



Create a file in a text editor called answers.csv that stores the following header and questions. Notice that interviewee is the same because we are linking it to a set of answers to a user, and the question_id field links our answer to a question. Feel free to add more fields and answers.
interviewee,question_id,answer
Anubhaw,12,(555) 555 - 5555
Anubhaw,10,arya0@uw.edu



Create a python program that adds answers to our csv file.
The program starts by reading in all the answers in the answers.csv file
Asks the interviewee for their name
Reads in all the questions in the questions.csv file
Prompts the user with every question and reads in the answer. Be sure to maintain the question_id relationship with every answer!
Once all questions have been answered, append those answers back out into the answers.csv file


Finally, we'll create a python program that prints both questions and answers.
Reads in all questions in the questions.csv file
Reads in all answers in the answers.csv file
Prints out the questions, one at a time, along with the corresponding set of answers from all interviewees. Format it nicely!
